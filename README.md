NixOps definition of my homelab!

I'm learning NixOps so the code quality (code reuse, layout strategy, etc.) is mediocre.

## Things to Learn

My roadmap to making a good use out of NixOps

### HOWTOs

- [ ] Define a directory structure
  - Per-host?
  - Per-functionality (akin to a role in Ansible)?

- [ ] Reuse code as much as possible

- [ ] Define a new host easily

- [ ] Keep track of the host inventory

- [ ] Document the infrastructure
  - [ ] Using a custom structure that exposes a `comment = types.str;` alongside
        preprocessing to remove the comments
  - [ ] Dynamically generate the documentation
  - [ ]
